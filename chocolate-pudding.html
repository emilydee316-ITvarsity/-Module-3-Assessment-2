                            <li>(Chocolate Pudding) Chocolate puddings are a class of desserts with chocolate flavors. There are two main types: a boiled then chilled dessert, texturally a custard set with starch, commonly eaten.</li>
                            
                            
                            <li>(Vanila Ice cream) Vanilla ice cream is the most common and basic flavour of ice cream which is favourite amongst all. Vanilla ice cream is made by blending in vanilla essence in along with the eggs, cream, milk and sugar. The vanilla essence added gives the ice cream a very natural aroma and vanilla flavour. This ice-cream can also be made sugar-free by substituting low-fat by using low-fat ingredients like low-fat milk, low-fat cream etc..</li>
                            
                            
                            <li>(Grass Jelly) Grass jelly, or leaf jelly or herb jelly, is a jelly-like dessert eaten at our Restaurant. It is created by using the Platostoma palustre plant and has a mild, slightly bitter taste. It is served chilled, with other toppings such as fruit, or in bubble tea or other drinks.</li>
